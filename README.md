Hi 👋 myself Soham!

I am a Mathematician, working as a Data Scientist to solve some of the toughest problems on Earth using data. I believe “Data is the new Oil” and there is always a way to provide “Intelligence in Every Byte”. I mostly work with geospatial data along with a strong love for NLP based problems. I hope my projects here on Github might help folks get ideas.

Here are some info about me:

 * 💻 I’m currently working at Satsure Bangalore.

 * 💬 Ask me about anything.
 * 🥳 Don't forget to enjoy the life.
 * ⚡ Fun fact: Time enjoyed is never wasted.
