Hi 👋 myself Soham!
About myself
I am a Data Scientist by profession and love reading books in my spare time. I mostly deal with geospatial data, solving some of the toughest problems on earth using satellite imagery. I also have a love for NLP based problems. I hope my projects here on Github might help folks get ideas.

Here are some info about me:

💻 I’m currently working at Satsure Bangalore.
